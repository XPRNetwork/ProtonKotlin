Kotlin library for handling Proton Chain operations. The main purpose
for this library is for account and key management, but also handles
signing and pushing transactions.

**Important:** *This library is currently under heavy development.
Please be aware that all functionality is subject to change at any time.
Documentation and examples are also being worked on and will change
over time.*

# Installation

This library is hosted by Github Packages so you will need to provide your Github
credentials for access.

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven {
            name = "ProtonKotlinSdk"
            url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/ProtonProtocol/ProtonKotlin")
            credentials {
                ...
                username = properties.getProperty('github.username')
                password = properties.getProperty('github.token')
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Then add the following dependency to your module's build.gradle

```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "com.metallicus:protonsdk:{latest_version}"
}
```

*The minimum Android SDK requirement is 21.*

# Usage

The main class that you will interface with is `Proton` which
encapsulates all the needed functions.

First you will need to initialize with either a MainNet or TestNet url.

MainNet:

```
https://api.protonchain.com
```

TestNet:

```
https://api-dev.protonchain.com
```

This is recommended during app startup.

```kotlin
override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    
    Proton.getInstance(this).initialize(protonChainUrl)
}
```

Once initialized you will be able to:
- Fetch Chain Provider info
- Fetch Token Contracts
- Find Proton accounts given a public or private key
- Generate and/or securely store a private key
- Set and store an "active" account

Once an active account has been set you can:
- Fetch token balances (with exchange rates) for active account
- Fetch transaction history for active account
- Update account name and avatar
- Transfer tokens from active account to another account

Most of these functions require network connectivity and will return a
LiveData resource.  
This LiveData can be observed and will emit the current state of the
action.

Here is an example of fetching Chain Provider info with the appropriate
observable states:

```kotlin
Proton.getInstance(context).getChainProvider().observe(this, Observer { chainProviderResource ->
    when (chainProviderResource?.status) {
        Status.SUCCESS -> {
            // Handle success state
        }
        Status.ERROR -> {
            // Handle error state
        }
        Status.LOADING -> {
            // Handle loading state
        }
    }
})
```

You can follow this format for most of the functions called within
`Proton`.
